        <strong>Abstract</strong> — Conventionally large metal oxygen tanks weighing
        tens of kilograms are used as apparatus for breathing
        underwater which decreases the diving time and restricts us
        from exploring the deeper parts of the sea for a longer period
        of time. Considering this thesis, this particular research
        develops an underwater breathing system which is designed
        based on fish gills. This approach uses the principle of
        counterflow diffusion to extract dissolved oxygen from
        surrounding water and supply it directly to the deoxygenated
        blood coming from the body, eliminating the gas phase in
        between. A hypothetical system is developed based on the
        solution provided below. This paper specifically deals with the
        concept and the mathematical formulations of the phenomena
        that would be used in the development of this device.

      <strong>Introduction</strong><br><br>
        The current methods for breathing underwater uses old
        conventional designs which greatly reduce our productivity.
        Existing conventional methods of breathing underwater can
        be divided into two types: Oxygen tanks and surface
        supplied method. These methods have some limitations like
        less diving time and large weight. Development of new
        methods of underwater breathing is therefore required.
        The Oxygen present in atmosphere gets dissolved in water
        because of the its partial pressure [1] which can be used for
        breathing underwater. To extract this oxygen, diffusion
        process is used. Diffusion is mass transfer phenomenon
        which induces the flow of mass due to concentration
        difference. The proposed system uses this very principle for
        exchange of gases between blood and water.
        The contents of our research are distributed in the paper as
        follows: Section I describes introduction, Section II
        describes the core concept, Section III deals with the
        mathematical model, Section IV explains the design aspects
        of the device, Section V describes our hypothetical setup,
        Section VI sheds light on our future plans for the device.
      
      <br><br><br>
      <strong>Core Concept</strong><br><br>
        Our system closely mimics the natural structure of fish gills.
        fish uses the phenomena of counterflow diffusion to absorb
        oxygen from surrounding water; water flows over the gills and 
        passes through the structure called primary lamellae [2],
        which consists of sub-structures called secondary lamellae,
        this is where the diffusion happens. The concentration of
        oxygen and carbon dioxide [3][4] dissolved in water
        depends upon the partial pressure gradient of gases between
        water and atmosphere. Now as the blood and water move in
        counter current direction in the gills; blood in lamellae and
        water over it, a partial pressure gradient exist between the
        deoxygenated blood and oxygen rich water. This results in
        the diffusion of oxygen into the blood from water. Carbon
        dioxide on the other hand diffuses from blood into the water
        because of its high concentration in blood as compared to
        water [5]. This is how a fish gill works.
        The countercurrent flow of blood and water has a reason.
        Suppose if the blood in the gills and water around it moved
        in the same direction in the fish gills, that is if they flowed
        parallel to each other, then the gas exchange occurs until
        their concentration became equal, since after that no partial
        pressure gradient exists, no diffusion occurs.

        Gas exchange in fish gills is based on the principle called
        Counterflow Diffusion.
        In the figure below a single element of gas exchange surface
        of a fish gill is shown, water and blood flow in
        countercurrent directions. Due to a positive partial pressure
        gradient of oxygen between water and blood (as indicated
        by representative values), oxygen diffuses into the blood.
        Carbon dioxide on the
        other hand diffuses from blood to water because of its
        positive partial pressure gradient between blood and water.
        The principle which drives the exchange of gases between
        the membrane and also governs the workings of fish gills is
        called the Fick’s law [6]. Fick’s law can be stated as “Rate
        of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide through the
        membrane depends on the partial pressure gradient along the
        membrane and the area of gas exchange”.<br><br>

        Mathematically, Rate of Diffusion (R)<br><br>
        $$ R = {D}{A}\frac{\delta{P}}{\delta{x}}$$<br>
        Where,<br><br>
        ${D}$ : is the diffusion coefficient,<br>
        ${A}$ : is the surface area of gas exchange,<br>
        ${\delta{P}}$ : is partial pressure gradient of gas,<br>
        ${x}$ : is the distance in the direction of diffusion of a gas <br><br>
        Prasoon kumar et al. carried out a computational study of
        diffusion phenomenon occurring in fish using a twodimensional model of a secondary lamellae in COMSOL
        [7], the governing equations they determined in each domain
        are
      </p>  
      <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime;"></br><br>
      $${U_w}\frac{\delta{C}}{\delta{x}} = {D_w}(\frac{\delta^2{C}}{\delta{x^2}} + \frac{\delta^2{C}}{\delta{y^2}})$$ ... Water Domain <br>
      $${U_b}\frac{\delta{C}}{\delta{x}} = {D_b}(\frac{\delta^2{C}}{\delta{x^2}} + \frac{\delta^2{C}}{\delta{y^2}})$$ ... Blood Domain <br>
      $${D_e}\frac{\delta^2{C}}{\delta{y^2}} = 0$$ ... Epithelial Barrier <br>
      $${N} = -{D}\frac{\delta{C}}{\delta{x}} + {U_x}{C}$$<br><br>
      Where,<br><br>
      ${U_w}$ = Average velocity in water channel,<br>
      $U_b$ = Average velocity in blood channel,<br>
      $D_w$ = Diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water,<br>
      $D_b$ = Diffusion coefficient of oxygen in blood,<br>
      $D_e$ = Diffusion coefficient of oxygen in epithelial matrix,<br>
      $C$ = Concentration of oxygen,<br>
      $N$ = Flux.
      <br><br>
      This model can easily be extrapolated to be applied to
      humans by inserting appropriate boundary conditions.

      <strong>A. Length of Tubes</strong><br><br>
      This parameter depends only on the partial pressure gradient
      of the gases that are exchanged through the membrane. With
      the increase in the length of the tube in the direction of flow
      of water, the concentration of oxygen in blood increases and
      saturation occurs. Thus, rendering the remaining length
      useless. A specific tube length is hence selected based on
      above phenomenon.
      In human lungs, the curve that depicts the increase in
      concentration of oxygen in blood along the oxygen gradient
      rise is sigmoidal in nature [8].
      Fitting the same curve along the length of breathing device
      gives the point of saturation of oxygen in blood and hence
      the length of the membrane tubes.
