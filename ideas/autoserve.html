                <strong>Autoserve is designed to address a common challenge faced by restaurants worldwide: the need to maintain a large workforce.</strong> 
                The system features a series of wheel-operated conveyor mechanisms that transport food orders from the kitchen to the designated tables and return empty dishes from the tables to the kitchen's washing area.
                Each table is equipped with a user interface that allows customers to browse the menu and place orders. Once an order is placed, a ticket is generated and sent to the chef’s interface, tagged with the corresponding table number. As the chef prepares the order, its status is updated on the interface, and customers receive real-time notifications. 
                Upon completion, the chef moves the order ticket to the “completed” section, places the food on the conveyor, and a weight sensor at the kitchen end detects the presence of the order, initiating delivery to the correct table.
                </br>
                </br>The conveyor system operates via motor-driven wheels, with sensors along the track to detect the presence of food items. A motion planning algorithm calculates which wheels need to rotate and to what degree, depending on the destination table number. Sensors continuously monitor the system, allowing free movement for other orders without unnecessary blockage.

                An additional area with a dedicated order kiosk supports takeaway services. Customers can place takeaway orders via the UI, and packaged meals are delivered directly to the customer’s location using the same ordering and ticketing system. An automated mechanism can be developed for food packaging to support this process.    
                Multiple conveyors can extend from the same kitchen to handle high order volumes efficiently. Tables are designed with integrated conveyor systems to minimize customer effort in retrieving food. Additionally, circular conveyors could be implemented at each table, allowing customers to easily pass dishes around.        
                </br></br>
                <strong>Skeptical Areas : </strong>
                </br>- The conveyor system must accommodate multiple food orders without allowing a single order to block the entire transport network.
                </br>- Empty plates should be automatically returned to the washing area via a separate conveyor system.
                </br>- The high number of actuators required for operation may increase the risk of frequent mechanical failures.
                </br>- A user-friendly return mechanism for empty plates needs to be developed to enhance customer experience.
                </br>- Automated table cleaning systems are essential, as customers may leave tables dirty after meals in a fully robotic restaurant.
                </br></br>
                <strong>Areas of Improvements :</strong>
               </br>- Incorporating computer vision for system monitoring could significantly boost efficiency, although it would increase system complexity.
                </br>- Adding lighting systems within the conveyors and transparent glass enclosures would enhance the restaurant’s ambience.
                </br>- A mobile robotic workforce could be introduced for additional support, though this would reintroduce workforce management challenges due to limited robot autonomy.
                </br>- Developing automated food preparation robots would further increase the automation rate, reducing dependence on human labor.                    
            </br></br>
                <strong>Goals :</strong>
                </br>- The system aims to create a memorable dining experience where customers can enjoy the ambience and watch the impressive, fully automated process in action.
                
                </br></br>
                <strong>Potential Challenges :</strong>
                    <br>- Similar robotic restaurant concepts already exist, reducing the novelty factor.
                    <br>- Public resistance toward robotic systems in customer-facing environments could affect adoption.
