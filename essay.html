            if you’re going to try, go all the
            way. otherwise, don’t even start.
            <br><br>
            if you’re going to try, go all the
            way. this could mean losing girlfriends,
            wives, relatives, jobs and
            maybe your mind.
            <br><br>
            go all the way.
            it could mean not eating for 3 or
            4 days.
            it could mean freezing on a
            park bench.
            it could mean jail,
            it could mean derision,
            mockery,
            isolation.
            isolation is the gift,
            all the others are a test of your
            endurance, of
            how much you really want to
            do it.
            and you’ll do it
            despite rejection and the
            worst odds
            and it will be better than
            anything else
            you can imagine.
            <br><br>
            if you’re going to try,
            go all the way.
            there is no other feeling like
            that.
            you will be alone with the
            gods
            and the nights will flame with
            fire.
            <br><br>
            do it, do it, do it.
            do it.
            <br><br>
            all the way
            all the way.
            you will ride life straight to
            perfect laughter,
            it’s the only good fight
            there is.

          <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:25px;";><strong>a hypothetical time machine</strong></p>
          <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:16px;";>
            Time machine in layman’s terms is a device which takes us to the past or the future. Although this definition is simple, we need to probe into the meanings of the words past and the future to check the validity of these concepts. From relativity, we know that there are 4 dimensions (11 from string theory but that’s a subject of another discussion) three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. Out of these 4 dimensions we have a hold on the spatial dimensions like we can move forward and backward in space, the x, y and z directions but time only flows in one direction. 
            <br><br>One cannot reverse the direction of time. The other way to say this is that the entropy of a system always increases. Time can possibly only move in the reverse order only during the event of a big crunch (when the universe contracts instead of expanding and during that all your life events will occur in a reverse order - that is first you will grow old and then younger.)
            Though moving in the future is possible because the time already flows in that direction and we are already moving in the future. That means we are already travelling on a one way time machine and we have travelled through our past. All the past events that we travelled through are stored in our memories. We can easily remember some events which occurred to us and others in the recent past and some prominent events from our far past. As we move forward in our future, the memory of the far past diminishes since our brains have limited data storage capacity (if you are not Lucy). Our brains are developed through evolution and it will take a long time to evolve them to have infinite memory and work at full capacity. Computers also store data and have memories. We can have a computer that can store infinite memory. Each individual’s past is every event she lived and those events are stored as data in our memory. Potentially building a computer with an infinite memory can be used to store data about each organism’s past on this earth. A lot of disorganized information which can be structured using unsupervised machine learning and a mapping of the past can be created which our time machines can travel through using technologies such as AR/VR.
            <br><br>Now, from the above discussion we can say that we have opened a gateway to the past that we can travel using the machines of infinite memory which I call computers for now. But the question is can we change the past? Can we change the events we already live with and can we change the events which are going to happen to us in the future?
            I think there is possibly no way that we can use to change the events that took place in the past. But I have a theory which can be used to change the future. I will present that theory with the following.
            Here we will start with a very simple example. Suppose that you are a very simple organism and you have only 5 things to do in the future (Normal humans might have countless things to do). Each thing here is something you will either fail or succeed at. Mathematically speaking each of these events have a probability distribution (which are random, may be normal, may be uniform or maybe some other type we don't know). Graphically it can be shown as following [INSERT FIGURE]
            This is the place machine learning models and computers come in. First we need to know a function that gives us the probability of failure or success of a future event by learning from all the past events stored in our computer using unsupervised learning. But one could ask here that if we have found the mapping from the past events to the future events then how can one change the future? Here comes the juicy part. Using Inverse mapping (the inverse of our nonlinear function) which we defined above using unsupervised learning helps us do the trick and change our future. 
            <br><br>Imagine that for a particular event out of the 5 things defined above we assume a very high probability of success for that event. Finding the inverse of that probability distribution can help us find the list of events performing which we can change the future. So welcome to your successful future. The trick here in the above argument is finding that nonlinear function which is extremely difficult and I would assume that it is equivalent to coming up with the grand unified theory) So what can we do to change the future? Make good decisions, work hard and work smart. These things can change the probability distribution and in fact every infinitesimally small moment after this moment is the future and the transition from that infinitesimally small moment and that next infinitesimally small event is called Life.

        <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:25px;"><strong>code to learn</strong></p>
        <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:16px;">
          I recently had an epiphany: everyone should learn how to code and program, and there's a specific rationale behind it. Firstly, we often emphasize that in order to grasp a concept or absorb knowledge, whether it pertains to finance, science, economics, politics, or any subject of study, explaining it to someone else enhances our understanding. This principle aligns with Richard Feynman's perspective that if you can't teach a concept, you might not fully comprehend it yourself. Now, while you might not always have a person available to teach in front of you, there's a constant resource on your desk: your computer.
          <br><br>
          I'd argue that computers are currently among the least intelligent entities we possess. They are even less capable than many organisms on Earth. They lack innate learning abilities. Despite the existence of artificial intelligence and machine learning, which imbue computers with the capacity to think and make predictions based on pattern recognition, computers inherently lack the capability to learn independently.
          However, by acquiring coding skills, any concept you understand can be readily translated into a code and communicated to a computer. When the computer comprehends the input, processes it effectively, and produces an output matching your hypothesized or predicted result, it signifies a profound grasp of the concept. This perspective shapes my belief that learning programming languages, whether it's C++, C, Python, C#, Assembly language, or any other, holds significant value.
          <br><br>
          In conclusion, my viewpoint is that learning programming languages can enhance your understanding of various subjects and concepts. It provides a pathway to effectively communicate and test your comprehension by interacting with computers.

        <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:25px;";><strong>entropy</strong></p>
        <p align="left" style="color:black; font-family: Courier Prime; font-size:16px;";>
          What is physics all about? One could say it is a discipline of sciences that includes the study of laws of nature;
          In fact Physics is a very wide branch including the study in very minutest regimes such as that of Quarks which are the basic constituents of the elementary particles such as electron ,protons,neutrons,and other anti particles ; 
          to the farthest of the universe where one’s imagination cannot even reach. 
          <br><br>These regimes of physics are described in quantum physics, theory of relativity,cosmology,laws of thermodynamics and string theory.First I would like to write something about laws of thermodynamics and out of the four laws of thermodynamics the law which interests me and many other a lot is the Second law of thermodynamics. 
          It can be stated as “Entropy of the universe always increases”. Entropy is a quantity that assigns a particular direction to all the laws of nature.For example consider a glass filled with water kept on a table ,suppose the glass falls down ,for this phenomena there might be some quantity that governs the fall of glass in direction in which the glass falls, why the glass breaks and why doesn’t the phenomena occur in the reverse order ,this is only due to increase in the entropy of universe.
          Events may happen in reverse order only during the big crunch. Every physics learner with keen interest in astrophysics knows that since big bang universe is expanding.This expansion depends on a certain critical density.During the big crunch the universe contracts, event occurs in reverse index order, In such a contacting universe one might die first and the born.The universe would contract till the Planck length before the big bang. 
          It seems that the big crunch violates the second law of Thermodynamics as the disorder decreases in this case .One of the other thought experiment violating the law of Thermodynamics was first proposed by Maxwell as “Maxwell’s demon”.
          <br><br>Consider a room which is divided by a partition wall with a small gate,suppose the part A of the room is at a higher temperature and part B is at lower temperature,on microscopic scale the average momentum distribution molecules in A is more than that in B, now suppose a demon sits on the gate controlling it such that as a molecule having higher momentum from part B reaches near the gate ,the demon opens the gate and allows it to move in A,and also when a low molecular momentum particle moves towards B the gate is opened by the demon and it allows the particle to move in B.
          After some time average molecular momentum of A would be so high that its temperature would increase which is against the law of thermodynamics.
          But the demon might have to do some work which might increase the entropy more than the decrease in above paradox and so ultimately the entropy of universe increases .
          This is some like how the physics takes us to the frontiers of universe and back to a glass of water.
          <br><br>Physics is interesting!!!
